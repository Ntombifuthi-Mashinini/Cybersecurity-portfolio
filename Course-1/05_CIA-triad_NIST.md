Course 1 – Topic 05: CIA Triad & NIST

The CIA Triad—Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability—is the foundation of all cybersecurity principles. Paired with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, these models guide organizations in building strong and resilient security strategies.

What is the CIA Triad?

The CIA Triad focuses on three core principles:

| Principle        | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Confidentiality | Ensuring only authorized users have access to sensitive data.               |
| Integrity      | Making sure data is accurate and unaltered by unauthorized actors.         |
| Availability   | Guaranteeing that information and systems are accessible when needed.      |

> Example Applications:
> - Confidentiality: Encrypting files and emails
> - Integrity: Using digital signatures and checksums
> - Availability: Backup systems and uptime monitoring

NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed a framework to help organizations manage cybersecurity risks with a structured approach.

The 5 Core Functions of NIST CSF:

| Function  | Purpose                                            |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Identify  | Understand assets, systems, and potential risks    |
| Protect   | Implement safeguards to limit cybersecurity events |
| Detect   | Identify the occurrence of security breaches        |
| Respond  | Take appropriate actions during a cybersecurity event |
| Recover  | Restore capabilities and services post-incident     |

Personal Takeaways

What resonated with me the most:

- The CIA Triad isn't just a theory—it's applicable to everyday scenarios, from online banking to protecting healthcare records.
- I found it powerful that NIST's framework aligns naturally with the triad, helping companies take real action, not just tick boxes.
- It became clear that cybersecurity is not just about having tools but having a clear strategy and governance structure.
- Availability is often underrated—yet, if services aren't up and running during a crisis, everything else fails.
- I now view cybersecurity as a continuous cycle, not a one-time solution.

This topic helped me see that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility and that both frameworks give us a blueprint to keep systems safe and resilient.
