Course 1 – Topic 02: CISSP Security Domains, Types of Attack, and Understanding Attackers

CISSP Security Domains Overview

The CISSP certification is structured around eight domains, which represent key areas of cybersecurity knowledge:

1. Security and Risk Management
2. Asset Security
3. Security Architecture and Engineering
4. Communication and Network Security
5. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
6. Security Assessment and Testing
7. Security Operations
8. Software Development Security

These domains ensure comprehensive coverage of security principles, policies, and technologies used to protect information systems.


Determining Types of Attacks

Understanding the type of attack is essential for responding effectively. Attacks can generally be classified into categories:

- Passive Attacks – Monitoring or scanning systems without altering them (e.g., sniffing, traffic analysis).  
- Active Attacks – Actively trying to alter system resources or operations (e.g., DDoS, malware injection).  
- Insider Attacks– Threats coming from trusted individuals within the organization.  
- Outsider Attacks– External hackers using various techniques to gain unauthorized access.  
- Targeted Attacks– Highly planned and focused on specific individuals or systems (e.g., spear-phishing).  
- Opportunistic Attacks – Broad and automated, exploiting any available vulnerabilities (e.g., mass ransomware campaigns).

Understanding Attackers

Knowing who the attacker is helps in defending against them. Common types of attackers include:

1.Script Kiddies
- Use pre-made tools without deep knowledge.  
- Motivation:Thrill, curiosity.

2.Hacktivists
- Motivated by social or political causes.  
- Perform defacements or data leaks to gain attention.

3.Cybercriminals
- Motivated by financial gain.  
- Involved in fraud, ransomware, identity theft.

4.Insiders
- Current or former employees with access.  
- May act out of revenge or for profit.

5.State-Sponsored Actors
- Operate on behalf of nations.  
- Targets include critical infrastructure, government, and corporations.

6.Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
- Long-term, stealthy operations.  
- Involve high-level resources and planning.

Personal Reflections: What I Found Interesting

What I found most interesting in this topic is how organized and structured cybersecurity knowledge is under the CISSP domains. It shows that protecting systems isn't just technical—there’s a need for policy, operations, and even legal understanding.

I also found it fascinating how diverse attackers can be, from casual hobbyists to highly trained government agents. This range makes defending systems even more challenging, requiring multiple layers of security.

Understanding the types of attacks helped me see how even small mistakes (like weak passwords or unpatched software) can be exploited in very different ways depending on who the attacker is and what their goal is.

This topic helped me appreciate the importance of building security into every part of a system—not just at the network level, but from the ground up.
